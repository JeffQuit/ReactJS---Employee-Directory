# Unit 19 React Homework: Employee Directory

## Description

Project 19 tasked the student with building out an employee tracker using React as the main library with the funcationality to search for employees by name as well as order the list by one data type. As this assigment was given with very vague instructions, I decided to use my creative license and
turn this assignement into a themed assignement where I stylized my employee tracker with the style of the Alien(s) movie series theme.

The employee tracer I built stands out as it looks like something you would encounter as an HR represetative of Weyland Yutani Corporation, the largest, most powerful multi-spacial corpoation from the Alien(s) movie series. To do this, I found a Google font that matched the stylization as well as
used a dark grey with neon green accents design to replicate a green screen DOS background which you see on the spaceships and terminals in the Alien(s) movie series.

Once stylized, I then used the randomuser.me API to generate an array of random people objects which are then populated into the application via the Map method on the Employee Card component. Cards are arranged using CSS Grid to ensure responsive design for the grid if the display is collapsed.

Lastly, I added a search bar and age ordering functionality to meet the requirements of the assignment. The searchbar uses a dynamic search functionality where it actively searches on change of the text in the search bar. The ordering buttons will reorder the page based on the age of the employee.
